    My name is Federico Trotta, I am 25 years old. On June of 2021, I finished a
    Coding Bootcamp at Hack Academy. Place where I learned about front-end web
    development and back-end web development because it was an intensive 3-month
    course with more than 600hs of practice, that enhanced my programming skills
    in technologies like HTML, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React.js, Node.js,
    MySQL, MongoDB, etc.

    On June of 2021, I joined Tata Consultancy Services as an IT trainee in a
    junior technician position.

    I define my self as an always motivated person to learn new things, not so
    fast learner but a persistent learner. I enjoy learning things that I can
    put in practice while I learn them, because that always helps me to a better
    understanding of things.
